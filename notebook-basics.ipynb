Most importantly, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts for efficiently performing notebook and cell actions. For example, pressing **`c`** when in command mode, will copy the current cell; no modifier is needed.\n",

    "The first concept to understand in mouse-based navigation is that **cells can be selected by clicking on them.** The currently selected cell is indicated with a grey or green border depending on whether the notebook is in edit or command mode. Clicking inside a cell's editor area will enter edit mode. Clicking on the prompt or the output area of a cell will enter command mode.\n",

    "The second concept to understand in mouse-based navigation is that **cell actions usually apply to the currently selected cell**. For example, to run the code in a cell, select it and then click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-play icon-play\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Cell -> Run`** menu item. Similarly, to copy a cell, select it and then click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-copy icon-copy\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Edit -> Copy`** menu item. With this simple pattern, it should be possible to perform nearly every action with the mouse.\n",

When they are rendered, a nice formatted representation of the cell's contents will be presented. When they are unrendered, the raw text source of the cell will be presented. To render the selected cell with the mouse, click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-play icon-play\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Cell -> Run`** menu item.
